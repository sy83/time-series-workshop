                    Real world data in many domains is multimodal and heterogeneous, such as healthcare, social media, and climate science. Tensors, as generalizations of vectors and matrices, provide a natural and scalable framework for handling data with inherent structures and complex dependencies.  Recent renaissance of tensor methods in machine learning ranges from academic research on scalable algorithms for tensor operations, novel models through tensor representations, to industry solutions including Google TensorFlowï¼ŒTorch and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).  In particular, scalable tensor methods have attracted considerable amount of attention, with successes in a series of learning tasks, such as learning latent variable models, relational learning, spatio-temporal forecasting and training deep neural networks. </br>

                    <p class ="large text-muted"> 
                    These progresses trigger new directions and problems towards tensor methods in machine learning. The workshop aims to foster discussion, discovery, and dissemination of research activities and outcomes in this area and encourages breakthroughs. We will bring together researchers in theories and applications who are interested in tensors analysis and development of tensor-based algorithms. We will also invite researchers from related areas, such as numerical linear algebra, high-performance computing, deep learning, statistics, data analysis, and many others, to contribute to this workshop. We believe that this workshop can foster new directions, closer collaborations and novel applications. We also expect a deeper conversation regarding why learning with tensors at current stage is important, where it is useful, what tensor computation software and hardware work well in practice and, how we can progress further with interesting research directions and open problems.

                        <p>Prof. Amnon Shashua holds the Sachs chair in computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His field of expertise is computer vision and machine learning. For his academic achievements he received the MARR prize Honorable Mention in 2001, the Kaye innovation award in 2004, and the Landau award in exact sciences in 2005.</p>
        <p>In 1999 Prof. Shashua co-founded Mobileye, an Israeli company developing a system-on-chip and computer vision algorithms for a driving assistance system, providing a full range of active safety features using a single camera. Today, approximately 11 million cars from 25 automobile manufacturers rely on Mobileye technology to make their vehicles safer to drive. In August 2014, Mobileye claimed the title for largest Israeli IPO ever, by raising $1B at a market cap of $5.3B. In addition, Mobileye is developing autonomous driving technology with more than a dozen car manufacturers. An early version of Mobileyeâ€™s autonomous driving technology was deployed in series as an "autopilot" feature in October, 2015, and will evolve to support more autonomous features in 2016 and beyond. The introduction of autonomous driving capabilities is of a transformative nature and has the potential of changing the way cars are built, driven and own in the future.</p>
        <p>In 2010 Prof. Shashua co-founded OrCam which harnesses computer vision artificial intelligence to assist people who are visually impaired or blind. The OrCam MyEye device is unique in its ability to provide visual aid to hundreds of millions of people, through a discreet wearable platform. Within its wide-ranging scope of capabilities, OrCamâ€™s device can read most texts (both indoors and outdoors) and learn to recognize thousands of new items and faces.</p><br>
